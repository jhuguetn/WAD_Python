 Congratulations, if you read this you succeeded in opening pywad's documentation. It is assumed you have installed the necessary python packages and an up and running WAD QC framework.
The tools are located in the Tools folder. To use the plugins in the WAD QC framework one has to upload the pywadplugin.py.zip file as a new plugin with the
WAD software. If no pywadplugin.py.zip file exists it can be created using
the following command from the root folder of the package:

``python Tools/pywad2zip.py zip``
