This tool converts the generated XML files into a dicom file and sends them to DCM4CHEE pacs.

USE AT OWN RISK!

This folder contains the source code and executable for the processing of PETQC reports generated by Siemens Biograph PET CT scanners.
The executable has to be installed on the system (AT YOUR OWN RISK!!) and the configuration file has to be appropriately configured.

-The source code is located in the source directory.
-The executable is located in the bin directory. To make downloading in practice easier the executable has been renamed.

It is HIGHLY recommended you compile your own executable from the source code using python setup.py
